Unit Testing for User Registration Validation
This project involves developing a simple user registration validation system, where the user must provide their username, email, and password through command-line input. The goal is to implement functions that validate the user input based on specified criteria and to write unit tests using pytest to ensure the correct behavior of these functions.

Features
Username Validation:

The username should not be empty.

The username should not contain any spaces.

Password Validation:

The password should be at least 8 characters long.

The password must contain at least one number.

The password must include at least one letter.

The password must include at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*).

Email Validation:

The email should contain both @ and . characters.
